INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TESTING
There are two approaches to testing. In one case we test from the userâ€™s point of view, 
so we can only test what is exposed; this is called external testing. 
The test files should be in the {packagename}_test package, in the same folder.

In the second case, called internal testing, we know everything that goes on inside and we want to test the unexposed functions. 
The test files should be in the same package as the source file.
These two approaches are not exclusive, and should be seen as complementary.
